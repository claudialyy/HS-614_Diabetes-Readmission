# HS-614_Diabetes-Readmission-final-project

This diabetes dataset from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008 is a record of 10 years(1999-2008) of clinical care at 130 US hospitals. Through my study, I will explore which features have a high chance of affecting readmission and predict the probability of patient readmission.
